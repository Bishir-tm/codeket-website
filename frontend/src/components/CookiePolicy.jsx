          <p className="text-white mt-2">
            Some browsers have incorporated "Do Not Track" (DNT) features that
            can send a signal to the websites you visit indicating you do not
            wish to be tracked. Currently, there is no standard for how online
            services should respond to DNT signals. We currently do not respond
            to DNT signals, whether the mechanism is from a particular browser
            or from a third-party service.
