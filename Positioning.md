## 🧠 What is Codeket?

**Codeket** is a software company that builds practical, focused tools for growing businesses that need operational control without complexity.
We design modern, task-specific solutions—clean interfaces, fast onboarding, and real-world usability—without the clutter of bloated ERP suites or generic SaaS products.

## 🧭 Who We Build For

- **Businesses that need control** over stock, operations, customer experience, or service delivery.
- **Teams that can’t afford inefficiency** but don’t want a dedicated IT department.
- **Serious operators**—small to mid-sized companies ready to modernize how they work.
- Not hobbyists, not global multinationals, and not single-person freelancers.

**Purpose-Built Products**
Every product solves a clear operational problem—for example:

- Branded 360° virtual tours for real estate marketing.

**Intuitive Design**
If your team needs training, we missed the mark. Our tools are simple, fast, and clear. No unnecessary layers.

## 🧱 What Codeket is NOT

  We don’t try to do everything.

- **Not for logistics warehouses, manufacturing plants, or global conglomerates.**
  Our focus is retail, education, and service-driven businesses.

- **Not another generic app with a nice website but no depth.**
  Our tools are pressure-tested by real businesses before launch.

- **Not bargain-basement.**
  Pricing is fair and sustainable—affordable for serious businesses, never free or bloated.
